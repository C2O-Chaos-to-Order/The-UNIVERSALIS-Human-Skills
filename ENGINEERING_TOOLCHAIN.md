# Engineering Toolchain and Initial Build Plan

**Repository:** `C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Human-Skills`  
**Repository responsibility:** Human Skills  
**Status:** Initial executable foundation proposed in this branch; specialized candidates remain proposed pending verification.  
**Boundary:** UNIVERSALIS public / independently operable. Do not add C2O-private credentials, policies, authority state, or private operational data.

## 1. Universal engineering foundation

This repository adopts the following baseline in proportion to its code and data:

- GitHub Actions CI with least-privilege workflow permissions.
- Automated tests and schema/configuration validation.
- CodeQL or equivalent static analysis, secret scanning, dependency review, and Dependabot after repository settings and alert ownership are confirmed.
- CycloneDX or SPDX SBOM generation, dependency vulnerability review, and action dependency inventory.
- Pinned toolchain versions, immutable action references, build provenance, and release signing as release workflows mature.
- Versioned specifications, changelogs, test fixtures, execution records, and explicit limitations.

**Candidate foundation tools from the owner-supplied proposal:** Secure SDLC Evidence Collector; repo-assurance; Chainguard Actions; cnspec SBOM Cataloger; actionlint; CodeQL; OSV-Scanner; Trivy/Grype; Gitleaks; CycloneDX/SPDX; SLSA provenance and in-toto attestations; cosign. These are candidates, not verified installations.

## 2. Repository-specific tools

Prufa for accessibility and user-flow verification; PAISL for consent and sovereignty evaluation; skill taxonomy, learning progression, assessment rubrics, and accessible practice records. Agent-skill sandbox tools are not substitutes for human learning assessment.

All candidate names and capability descriptions originate in the owner-supplied 2026-11-12 research submission. Before adoption, verify the canonical source, license, maintainer, release activity, security posture, compatibility, data flow, and test evidence. Do not infer implementation from a product description.

## 3. Initial implementation in this branch

- `.github/workflows/repository-quality.yml`: CI workflow running a dependency-free validator.
- `.github/scripts/repository_quality_baseline.py`: validator self-test and JSON validation for contract/schema/manifest directories plus `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`.
- This deliberately starts with a narrow, deterministic check. It does not claim to replace CodeQL, secret scanning, SBOM generation, formal ontology validation, accessibility audits, or domain-specific tests.

## 4. Next build increments

1. Inventory existing code, manifests, schemas, tests, and workflow permissions.
2. Add domain-native schema/contract fixtures and negative tests.
3. Add the relevant domain conformance harness and security scanner after source/license review.
4. Generate and archive SBOM, dependency, test, and provenance evidence.
5. Record failures, uncertainty, limitations, and verification status; never mark an unexecuted check as passed.

## Cross-repository architecture register — 2026-11-12

The following are the canonical working records for the latest owner-supplied toolchain proposals. This repository records the references and boundary rules; implementation belongs in the domain-owning repositories.

### Human Knowledge
- [C2O Human Knowledge architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-C2O-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/HUMAN_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md), [shared MCP interface contracts](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-C2O-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/MCP_INTERFACE_CONTRACTS.md), and [validation evidence](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-C2O-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/HUMAN_KNOWLEDGE_VALIDATION.md).
- [UNIVERSALIS Human Knowledge architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/HUMAN_KNOWLEDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md), [shared MCP interface contracts](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/MCP_INTERFACE_CONTRACTS.md), and [validation evidence](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Human-Knowledge/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/HUMAN_KNOWLEDGE_VALIDATION.md).

### OS provisioning and virtualization
- [C2O private provisioning architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-C2O-Ecosystem/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/OS_PROVISIONING_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- [UNIVERSALIS open provisioning architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Ecosystem/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/OS_PROVISIONING_ARCHITECTURE.md).

### UNIVERSALIN Grid, Guardian, and Golden Compass
- [C2O boundary and verifier architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-C2O-Ecosystem/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/UNIVERSALIN_GUARDIAN_GOLDEN_COMPASS.md).
- [UNIVERSALIS Grid / Guardian / Compass architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Ecosystem/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/UNIVERSALIN_GUARDIAN_GOLDEN_COMPASS.md).

### Boundary and evidence status
C2O-private credentials, policies, identity state, authority tokens, private source text, and operational evidence remain inside authorized C2O environments. UNIVERSALIS remains public, local-first, inspectable, and independently operable. Only versioned, explicitly approved interface schemas and evidence packages may cross the boundary; an interface does not grant authority.

All named external tools remain owner-supplied candidates or reference patterns pending canonical-source, license, maintainer, release, security, compatibility, and claim verification. No candidate is represented as installed or adopted merely because it appears in these records.

## Powers energy architecture register — 2026-11-12

Powers treat energy efficiency as a measurable, enforceable, auditable capacity—not only a permission or evaluation. In the current UNIVERSALIS repository set, the canonical implementation is maintained in the Intelligence Powers repository.

- **Canonical open architecture:** [UNIVERSALIS Powers energy architecture](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Intelligence-Powers/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/POWERS_ENERGY_ARCHITECTURE.md).
- **Shared v1 contract:** [Powers energy schema](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Intelligence-Powers/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/schemas/powers/powers-energy-contracts.v1.schema.json).
- **Executed checks and limitations:** [Powers validation record](https://github.com/C2O-Chaos-to-Order/The-UNIVERSALIS-Intelligence-Powers/blob/implementation/repository-foundation-2026-11-12/POWERS_ENERGY_VALIDATION.md).

The open implementation is local-first and independently operable. Measurement, forecasting, receipts, and synergy calculation do not require a central database or truth authority. It keeps actual workload telemetry and local policy in the operator's chosen environment. The shared contract excludes private credentials and policy values. PDU/RAPL/Kepler/GPU layers require overlap reconciliation; synergy comparisons require matched workload cohorts and SLO profiles. External tools and their advertised savings remain candidates until independently verified.
